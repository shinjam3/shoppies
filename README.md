## Preparations before downloading and running the project:
* Please have Node.js installed. I am currently using Node.js version 12.16.3 for this project.

## To run the project, please follow these steps in sequence, carefully or the program will not work properly:
1. Download the .zip file from this repository and extract the .zip file.
1. On the command prompt/terminal, go to the root directory of the extracted file.
1. On the same terminal, set environment variable "REACT_APP_API_KEY" to your OMDb API key. If you do not have one, you can get one for free at http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx
   * Note: use command "set" for Windows or "export" for macOS.
   * For example: >> set REACT_APP_API_KEY=123456.
1. On the same terminal, run "npm start" to run the web application.
1. To close the program on the terminals, simply close both terminals.
